# Snake Game

This project implements a simple Snake Game using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The game features a snake that grows longer by eating apples while avoiding collisions with itself and the game boundaries.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **index.html:** The main HTML file that contains the canvas element and includes the JavaScript file.
- **snake-game.js:** The main JavaScript file that contains the game logic.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Press any arrow key to start the game.
3. Control the snake with arrow keys, try to eat as many apples as possible, and avoid collisions.
4. The game will display a "You lost!" message if the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries, and it will restart after 5 seconds automatically.
5. If the player reaches the maximum score, a "You won!" message will be displayed, and the game will restart automatically after 10 seconds.
